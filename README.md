# csvReaderPractice
Just testing out a csv file reader I wrote, given the input of the .csv file I provided.
If following the same format you can add more data or make your own file with the same format.
It has a scanner in it to ask the user for input on what you wish to retrieve from the file.
I used a BufferedReader as my way of scanning then splitting by String.split(","); method into an array.
